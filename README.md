# Advanced Base Converter in Java

This is a console-based Java program that allows users to input a number in one base (Decimal, Binary, Hexadecimal, or Octal) and convert it to another base. It uses the `Scanner` class for input and built-in Java methods for number parsing and conversion.

## ⚙️ Features
- Converts between four common bases:
  - Decimal
  - Binary
  - Hexadecimal
  - Octal
- Input validation for base selection
- Uses Java’s `Integer.parseInt()` and conversion methods for accurate results
- Outputs in uppercase for clarity (especially with hexadecimal)

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Make sure you have Java installed.
2. Compile the file
